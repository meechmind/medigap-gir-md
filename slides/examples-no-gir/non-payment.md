<h3>Example Scenarios</h3>
<h2>Dropped for Non-Payment of Premiums</h2>
    <div class="scenario-box negative">
    <div class="scenario-label negative">✗ No GIR</div>
    <h3>Patricia, 66</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem">Had Medigap Plan N but fell behind on premium payments due to financial hardship. After 60 days of non-payment, coverage was terminated. Now she wants a new Medigap policy.</p>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Why Not</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem">Termination due to non-payment is specifically <em>excluded</em>. GIR applies only when termination is <span class="emphasis">involuntary</span> or due to issuer misconduct.<sup>25</sup></p>
