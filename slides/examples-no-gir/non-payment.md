<h2>When GIR Does NOT Apply</h2>
<div class="scenario-box negative">
<div class="scenario-label negative">✗ No GIR</div>
<h3>Dropped for Non-Payment of Premiums</h3>
<p><strong>Patricia, 66:</strong> Had Medigap Plan N but fell behind on premium payments due to financial hardship. After 60 days of non-payment, coverage was terminated. Now wants a new Medigap policy.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Why Not</h3>
<p>Trigger 5 specifically <em>excludes</em> termination due to non-payment. GIR applies only when termination is involuntary or due to issuer misconduct.<sup>25</sup></p>
<p style="color: var(--base); margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Consequence:</strong> Patricia will face medical underwriting and may face a pre-existing condition waiting period up to 6 months.</p>
