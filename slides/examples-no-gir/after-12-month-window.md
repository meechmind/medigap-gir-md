<h3>Voluntary Disenrollment After 12 Months</h3>
<p><strong>James, 71:</strong> Enrolled in Medicare Advantage 18 months ago. Now wants to switch to Original Medicare with Medigap because his doctors are leaving the plan network.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Why Not</h3>
<p>Trial rights (Triggers 6 and 7) only apply within the <span class="emphasis">first 12 months</span>. James waited too long—the trial window has closed.<sup>24</sup></p>
<p style="color: var(--base); margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Consequence:</strong> James will be subject to medical underwriting and may be denied coverage or charged higher rates.</p>
