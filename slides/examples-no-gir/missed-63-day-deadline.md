<h3>Missing the 63-Day Deadline</h3>
<p><strong>Helen, 75:</strong> Lost employer retiree coverage on March 1. Overwhelmed with other matters, didn't apply for Medigap until June (more than 63 days later).</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Why Not</h3>
<p>The 63-day window is a <span class="emphasis">hard deadline</span>. Helen originally had a valid GIR (Trigger 1), but she failed to act in time.<sup>27</sup></p>
<p style="color: var(--base); margin-top: 0.5rem;"><strong>Consequence:</strong> Helen has lost her guaranteed issue protection. There is <em>no extension or exception</em> for extenuating circumstances.</p>
</div>
<div class="highlight-box" style="border-color: var(--secondary); margin-top: 1rem;">
<p><strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If approaching a deadline, apply even if you haven't made a final decision—you can cancel within the 30-day free look period.</p>
