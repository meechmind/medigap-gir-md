<h2>When GIR Does NOT Apply</h2>
<div class="scenario-box negative">

<h3>Unhappy with MA But No Plan Misconduct</h3>
<p><strong>George, 69:</strong> Been in his Medicare Advantage plan for 3 years. Frustrated because claims processing takes longer than he'd like and customer service is poor.</p>
<h3 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Why Not</h3>
<p>Trial rights only apply within first 12 months. Trigger 3 (plan misconduct) requires <em>material</em> contract violations—not general dissatisfaction.<sup>26</sup></p>
<div class="warning-box" style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
<strong>What Would Qualify:</strong> Failure to provide medically necessary care in a timely manner, or material misrepresentation of benefits during enrollment.
