<h3>Example Scenarios</h3>
<h2>Unhappy with MA But No Plan Misconduct</h2>
<div class="scenario-box negative">
    <div class="scenario-label negative">✗ No GIR</div>
    <h3>George, 69</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem">Been in his Medicare Advantage plan for 3 years. He is frustrated because claims processing takes longer than he'd like and customer service is poor.</p>
    <h3 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Why Not</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1rem">Trial rights only apply within first 12 months. Plan misconduct requires <em>material</em> contract violations, not general dissatisfaction.<sup>26</sup></p>
</div>
<div class="highlight-box" style="margin-top: 1rem;">
    <p><strong>What Would Qualify:</strong> Failure to provide medically necessary care in a timely manner, or material misrepresentation of benefits during enrollment.</p>
</div>
